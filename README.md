# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📝 Project Overview

This project employs the **K-Means clustering** algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. The primary goal is to identify distinct customer groups, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Acquisition and Preparation:** Gather and preprocess customer data to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze data distributions and relationships to inform clustering.
- **Optimal Cluster Determination:** Utilize methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to identify the ideal number of clusters.
- **Model Implementation:** Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers effectively.
- **Visualization and Interpretation:** Visualize clustering results and interpret the characteristics of each segment.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** To create insightful visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm and evaluation metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To document and present the analysis process interactively.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Name:** Mall Customers Dataset  
- **Source:** [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- **Attributes:**
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `Gender`: Customer's gender.
  - `Age`: Customer's age.
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Customer's annual income in thousand dollars.
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer spending behavior.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values:** Checked and ensured no missing values in the dataset.
- **Feature Selection:** Selected relevant features (`Age`, `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`) for clustering.
- **Data Scaling:** Standardized the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Univariate Analysis:** Explored individual feature distributions to understand data spread and identify potential outliers.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Examined relationships between pairs of features to gain insights into customer behaviors.

---

## 🔢 Determining Optimal Clusters

- **Elbow Method:** Plotted Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to identify the 'elbow point' indicating the optimal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Analysis:** Calculated silhouette scores to validate the consistency within clusters and determine the optimal cluster count.

---

## 🤖 K-Means Clustering Implementation

- **Model Training:** Applied K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters determined from previous analysis.
- **Cluster Assignment:** Assigned cluster labels to each customer in the dataset.

---

## 📈 Results & Visualization

- **Cluster Visualization:** Plotted clusters in 2D and 3D spaces to observe the separation and characteristics of each group.
- **Cluster Profiles:**
  - **Cluster 1:** Young customers with high spending scores and moderate income.
  - **Cluster 2:** Older customers with low spending scores and high income.
  - **Cluster 3:** Middle-aged customers with average income and spending scores.
  - *(Note: Replace with your actual findings from analysis.)*

## 🎯 Business Implications

- **Targeted Marketing:** Enables businesses to design personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments.
- **Resource Allocation:** Helps in allocating resources effectively by focusing on high-value customer groups.
- **Customer Retention:** Identifies segments that may require improved engagement strategies to enhance loyalty.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Incorporate Additional Features:** Include more customer attributes like purchase history, online behavior, etc., for more granular segmentation.
- **Compare with Other Clustering Algorithms:** Evaluate performance against algorithms like Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, etc.
- **Automate the Pipeline:** Develop a streamlined pipeline for real-time customer segmentation as new data becomes available.
